            - \`release/*\` - Release preparation and versioning

            ### 🔄 Correct Workflow:
            \`\`\`
            feature/your-feature → develop → main
            bugfix/your-fix     → develop → main  
            hotfix/urgent-fix   → main (emergency only)
            \`\`\`

            ### 💡 How to Fix This:
            1. **Close this PR** ❌
            2. **Create a new PR:** \`${{ github.head_ref }} → develop\` ✅
            3. **After merge to develop:** Create \`develop → main\` PR for release 🚀
