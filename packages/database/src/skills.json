If the player using this Trait is holding the ball and places themselves in the opposition End Zone, the Block action will still be fully resolved before any touchdown is resolved.",
  "Unchannelled Fury": "Before taking any action (even if \"Knocked Down\", or without tackle zone), roll 1D6. On 1-3, can do nothing. If it is a single Action (Pass, Blitz, Throw Teammate's) the Action is lost for the team. Add +2 to the die if it is a Blitz, a Block or a Special Action replacing the Block."
